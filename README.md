Customer Short-Term Subscription Propensity Prediction

 

Problem statement- In November'2019, WrightVideo , a subscription video on demand company, released their paid-prime membership .

Within 2 months of its release, customers started paying for the premium subscription which allows them to watch all content available, there are still potential customers who are yet to subscribe.

WrightVideo approached us to identify customers and score their inclination (propensity) who would subscribe to the premium membership in coming two months

 

This is asked so that, WrightVideo can strategically create its maketing campaign , ensuring that customers who are likely to subscribe are reached out appropriately

Dataset - The dataset consists of 10,500 customers and the Timeline of the dataset is from January 2020 to December 2020

Output

Use the input data to create modelling features, build a model, predict the subscription likelihood (WrightVideo needs a subscription inclination score for each customer who have not subscribed yet)

Steps

Data Preparation
Create a training dataset
Generate test dataset (to include data points for non-subscribers)
Model Development
Experiment various algorithms
Assess model performance on the validation set and avoid overfitting
Ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data
Find keys features which drive the customer propensity
